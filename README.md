PYTHON-MODULES used

Subprocess - The subprocess module in Python is a built-in module that allows us to create new child processes. We can get exit codes, output, and error messages from these child processes. 
It is a valuable tool for executing external functions or commands in your Python code.

Sys - sys module provides access to variables and functions that interact closely with Python interpreter and runtime environment. It allows developers to manipulate various aspects of 
program execution and interpreter itself.

Datetime - A date in Python is not a data type of its own, but we can import a module named datetime to work with dates as date objects.

Socket - Socket programming is a way of connecting two nodes on a network to communicate with each other. One socket(node) listens on a particular port at an IP, 
while the other socket reaches out to the other to form a connection. The server forms the listener socket while the client reaches out to the server.
